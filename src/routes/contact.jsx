        <p className="contact-text">As a dynamic UI/UX designer and developer, I blend creative vision with business acumen to transform complex challenges into compelling digital experiences. Over seven years of expertise has taken me from founding a flourishing digital marketing agency to architecting sophisticated government applications. I excel at building lasting client relationships and delivering results â€“ evidenced by scaling multiple small businesses and expertly navigating federal stakeholder requirements.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          My mastery spans design systems and React development, but my true strength lies in driving business growth through thoughtful, user-centered design. I bring an entrepreneurial mindset to every project, whether I'm crafting high-fidelity prototypes, facilitating design sprints, or developing production applications with TypeScript and AWS.
